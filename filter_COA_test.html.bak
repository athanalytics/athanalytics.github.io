However, we received a credit which ended up being applied to a different invoice, and therefore Yale owes the vendor this amount to even out.  Here is the summary of what happened: â€¢	We got charged for a part we did not need via SI-02013795 ($520.22) and therefore requested for this invoice to be cancelled by Yale Central Finance. â€¢	Although the original was cancelled by Yale Central Finance, we also received a credit memo SI-01941391 ($470.37) from the supplier which was intended to offset this original invoice.  o	Because we had cancelled the original memo, this credit memo should not have been processed. â€¢	However, the Credit Memo SI-01941391 was applied to another balance which should have been paid in full (SI-01941392) via check number 4740174. â€¢	Therefore to make us whole with the supplier, we need to pay back the supplier. o	As an added complication, while the original charge was ~$520, we only received ~$470 back in credit due to shipping cost differences. The supplier noted their shipping costs increased. We decided we are ok to receive less of a credit due to higher shipping costs.  Therefore, we should process this invoice."	</td>	</tr>
